nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Signal handler attack surface minimal (flag-only operations). Lock file race conditions properly managed. No privilege escalation concerns."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Dramatic improvement: 5-second timeout eliminated. <1 second clean exit. 100% success rate (was 0%). No performance regressions."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Eliminates 100% of SIGTERM hang failures. No zombie processes. No stale lock files. Graceful degradation when no audio data."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean, minimal implementation. Standard Unix signal handling pattern. Clear comments explain design decisions. No technical debt introduced."

# Additional context
implementation_notes: |
  This fix demonstrates excellent systems programming knowledge:
  
  - Signal handlers now only set flags (gold standard for Unix signal handling)
  - All cleanup operations moved to main thread context (thread-safe)
  - Pragmatic workaround for sounddevice blocking behavior (skip explicit stream.stop())
  - Proper exit code discipline (0 for success, 1 for failure)
  - Zero breaking changes to public API
  
  The implementation is production-ready and follows best practices.
