# QA Testing Results Summary - Story 10.5
**Test Date:** 2025-10-28 (Post-Reboot)
**Tested By:** Quinn (Test Architect)

## Test Results Overview

### ✅ Test 1: First Run After Reboot (Healthy Environment)
- **Timing:** ~3 seconds (within 5s target ✓)
- **Behavior:** UV environment already healthy, no sync needed
- **Health Check:** Completed in 3 seconds (directory check, file check, Python import)
- **Result:** PASS - Fast startup when environment is healthy

### ✅ Test 2: Subsequent Run (Same Session)
- **Timing:** <1 second (within 1s target ✓)
- **Behavior:** Health check instant, no sync triggered
- **Result:** PASS - Very fast subsequent runs

### ✅ Test 3: Recording Workflow Integration (Story 10 + 10.5)
- **Recording Start:** Successful (PID 19698)
- **Stop Command:** 877ms (<1 second ✓)
- **Audio File:** 0.15 MB saved successfully
- **Lock File:** Cleaned up properly ✓
- **SIGTERM Handling:** Clean exit, no SIGKILL ✓
- **Result:** PASS - Story 10 SIGTERM fix working perfectly after reboot

### ✅ Test 4: UV Sync Triggered (Missing .venv)
- **Detection:** Immediate - ".venv directory missing" warning ✓
- **Sync Duration:** 3 seconds (16:24:33 to 16:24:36)
- **Total Time:** 3 seconds (within 5s target ✓)
- **Result:** PASS - Automatic sync works correctly
- **Dependencies Synced:** All packages including sounddevice, faster-whisper ✓

### ✅ Test 5: UV Sync Triggered (Missing uv.lock)
- **Detection:** Immediate - "uv.lock missing" warning ✓
- **Sync Duration:** 1 second (very fast!)
- **Total Time:** 1 second (well within 5s target ✓)
- **Result:** PASS - Lock file validation working

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

**AC1:** ✅ Dictation works on first use after restart (validated)
**AC2:** ✅ Automatic UV health check performed (3-layer validation working)
**AC3:** ✅ Comprehensive logging to /tmp/dictation-toggle.log (all operations logged)
**AC4:** ✅ Systemd service unchanged (Story 9 integration preserved)
**AC5:** ✅ Error handling follows existing patterns (notify-send, validation checks)
**AC6:** ✅ UV run execution path preserved (no changes to invocation)
**AC7:** ✅ Performance targets met:
  - First run: 3s (target <5s) ✓
  - Subsequent runs: <1s (target <1s) ✓
**AC8:** ✅ User-friendly error notifications (clear messages, log file reference)
**AC9:** ✅ Works across restart (validated post-reboot functionality)

## Performance Metrics

| Scenario | Target | Actual | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| First run (healthy venv) | <5s | 3s | ✅ PASS |
| First run (missing .venv) | <5s | 3s | ✅ PASS |
| First run (missing uv.lock) | <5s | 1s | ✅ PASS |
| Subsequent runs | <1s | <1s | ✅ PASS |

## Integration Testing

✅ **Story 10 + Story 10.5 Integration:**
- Recording workflow tested after reboot
- SIGTERM handling works correctly (877ms stop time)
- Audio file saved successfully (0.15 MB)
- Lock file cleanup verified
- No regressions detected

## Defects Found

**NONE** - All functionality working as designed.

## Recommendation

**Gate Status:** CONCERNS → **PASS**
**Quality Score:** 80 → **95**

**Rationale:**
- All 9 acceptance criteria validated with evidence
- Performance targets exceeded
- Integration with Story 10 confirmed working
- Three-layer health check functioning correctly
- UV sync behavior validated in multiple scenarios
- Zero defects found

**Story Status:** Ready for **Done**
