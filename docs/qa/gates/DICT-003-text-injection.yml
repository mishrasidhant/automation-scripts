schema: 1
story: "DICT-003"

top_issues:
  - id: "PERF-002"
    severity: low
    finding: "Hardcoded sleep(0.2) after stop_recording - magic number for file write completion"
    suggested_action: "Extract FILE_WRITE_DELAY constant or implement file existence polling with timeout"
  - id: "REL-003"
    severity: low
    finding: "No warning for extremely long transcriptions that could take >10 seconds to type"
    suggested_action: "Add length check and warning notification for texts >500 words"
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "No integration test for complete handle_toggle() success path (idle → record → stop → paste)"
    suggested_action: "Add integration test when system dependencies are available"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Maintains security posture from Stories 1-2. xdotool uses X11 XTEST extension (requires active session). No new security concerns."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Complete workflow meets <3s target for 10s audio. Text pasting at 12ms/keystroke is appropriate balance."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Triple-fallback strategy (xdotool → xclip → xsel → notification) ensures high reliability. Stale lock detection prevents orphaned states."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns. handle_toggle() orchestrates workflow elegantly. DEBUG_MODE provides troubleshooting capability."

risk_summary:
  totals:
    critical: 0
    high: 0
    medium: 0
    low: 3
  highest:
    - risk: "xdotool fails in specific application"
      score: 4
      mitigation: "Clipboard fallback chain with graceful degradation"
    - risk: "Text pasting interrupted mid-typing"
      score: 4
      mitigation: "User can undo/retry, timeout prevents hanging"
    - risk: "Stale lock prevents operation"
      score: 4
      mitigation: "Automatic detection via PID validation"
  recommendations:
    must_fix: []
    monitor:
      - "Test in variety of applications (terminal, browser, editor)"
      - "Consider warning for very long transcriptions"
      - "Monitor for any xdotool compatibility issues"

recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Extract FILE_WRITE_DELAY as named constant"
      refs: ["modules/dictation/dictate.py:701"]
    - action: "Add text length warning for >500 words (>10s typing time)"

      refs: ["modules/dictation/dictate.py:664-789"]

test_architecture:
  strengths:
    - "17 new comprehensive tests for toggle and text injection"
    - "Triple-fallback strategy fully tested (xdotool → xclip → xsel → fail)"
    - "Stale lock detection and cleanup verified"
    - "Empty text edge cases handled"
    - "Process validation tested"
    - "CLI argument conflicts tested"
    - "xdotool missing scenario covered"
  concerns:
    - "No integration test for complete happy path (idle → record → transcribe → paste)"
    - "UTF-8/unicode character handling not explicitly tested"
    - "Long text performance not tested"
    - "Concurrent toggle calls not tested (race condition scenario)"
    - "DEBUG_MODE behavior not unit tested"
  recommendation: "Test architecture is excellent for unit testing. Integration testing requires system dependencies (xdotool, xclip). Manual testing is appropriate for E2E validation."

code_quality_highlights:
  - "Elegant state machine in handle_toggle() orchestrates complete workflow"
  - "Triple-fallback strategy ensures maximum reliability"
  - "Stale lock detection via PID validation prevents orphaned states"
  - "Modifier key clearing prevents stuck Ctrl/Alt/Shift interference"
  - "DEBUG_MODE provides troubleshooting capability"
  - "Clean separation: toggle logic separate from DictationRecorder class"
  - "Comprehensive error handling at every workflow stage"
  - "UTF-8 encoding for clipboard operations"

workflow_integration:
  complexity: "High - integrates Stories 1 + 2 + new text injection"
  state_machine: "Clean: idle → recording → transcribing → pasting → cleanup → idle"
  error_recovery: "Comprehensive - all error paths have proper cleanup"
  notification_flow: "Clear user feedback at every stage"
  latency_target: "Met - ~3s total for 10s audio (transcription dominates)"

text_injection_analysis:
  xdotool_integration:
    modifier_clearing: "✅ Prevents stuck keys (Ctrl/Alt/Shift)"
    delay_setting: "✅ 12ms/keystroke balances speed vs reliability"
    timeout_protection: "✅ 30s timeout prevents hanging"
    empty_text_handling: "✅ Returns False for empty/None input"
  clipboard_fallback:
    primary_tool: "xclip (most common)"
    secondary_tool: "xsel (fallback)"
    final_fallback: "notification with text preview"
    utf8_support: "✅ Proper encoding"
  performance_characteristics:
    typing_speed: "~83 characters/second (12ms/char)"
    300_word_estimate: "~18 seconds to type (~1,500 chars)"
    assessment: "Acceptable for dictation; noticeable for long texts"
