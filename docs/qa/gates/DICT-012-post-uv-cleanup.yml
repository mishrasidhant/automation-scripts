  - Ready for git commit
  - Consider adding htmlcov/ to .gitignore in future enhancement

notes: |
  All cleanup operations completed successfully. Repository structure is clean,
  documentation is properly organized with clear archive markers, and all
  58 current functional tests pass (100%). 
  
  Test count reduction from 112 → 58 is EXPECTED and CORRECT:
  - Removed modules/dictation/ directory containing 54 deprecated pip-based tests
  - Retained all 58 current UV-based tests (100% retention)
  - Zero breaking changes detected
  
  The dictation module remains fully operational with UV-based package management.
  All core functionality validated:
  - Module imports working correctly
  - CLI commands operational
  - Configuration loading functional
  - UV environment properly synced (52 packages resolved, 49 audited)
  - Core dependencies (faster-whisper, sounddevice, numpy) installed and importable
  
  Documentation organization significantly improved:
  - docs/index.md provides clear navigation
  - docs/stories/README.md clearly separates current (8-12) from archived (1-7) stories
  - docs/qa/gates/README.md provides QA gate organization
  - All 8 deprecated documentation files removed
  - No pip references in active documentation (UV-based workflows only)
  
  Story 12 successfully completes the post-UV migration cleanup initiative.
  The automation-scripts repository is now fully modernized with UV package management
  and clean, organized documentation structure.
