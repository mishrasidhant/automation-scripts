# Test Suite Fix Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Script:** `modules/dictation/test-dictation.sh`  
**Status:** ✅ All tests passing (21/22)

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Portaudio Detection (Line 91-95)

**Problem:** The test used `ldconfig -p | grep libportaudio` which doesn't always show the library even when it's available.

**Fix:** Changed to test via sounddevice import:
```bash
test_portaudio_installed() {
    # Check if portaudio library is available via sounddevice import
    # This is more reliable than ldconfig which may not show it
    python3 -c "import sounddevice" 2> /dev/null && python3 -c "import sounddevice as sd; sd.query_devices()" 2> /dev/null
}
```

**Rationale:** If sounddevice can import and query devices, portaudio is definitely installed and working.

### 2. XFCE Hotkey Registration (Line 178-190)

**Problem:** The test searched all custom commands for "dictation" but the grep pattern wasn't matching correctly.

**Fix:** Query the specific hotkey property and check its value:
```bash
test_xfce_hotkey_registered() {
    if ! command -v xfconf-query &> /dev/null; then
        return 0  # Pass if not XFCE (handled by skip_test in main)
    fi
    
    # Check if the registered hotkey exists and points to dictation-toggle.sh
    # Check the default hotkey: <Primary>apostrophe (Ctrl+')
    local hotkey_path="/commands/custom/<Primary>apostrophe"
    local registered_cmd=$(xfconf-query -c xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts -p "$hotkey_path" 2> /dev/null)
    
    # Check if the command contains "dictation"
    echo "$registered_cmd" | grep -q "dictation"
}
```

**Rationale:** Directly check the specific hotkey property that setup.sh registers, rather than grepping through all commands.

## Prerequisites for Running Tests

1. **Activate virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/automation-scripts
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Ensure dependencies are installed:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements/dictation.txt
   ```

3. **Run test suite:**
   ```bash
   cd modules/dictation
   ./test-dictation.sh
   ```

---

## Notes

- The skipped test "Virtual environment activated" is informational - it skips because the test script can't detect activation state when called via script execution.
- All critical functionality tests pass.
- The module is ready for use.
