# Quality Gate Decision - Story 4: Hotkey Wrapper & Configuration
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "DICT-004"
story_title: "Hotkey Wrapper Script & Configuration"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "All functional requirements met with excellent implementation quality. Minor security consideration regarding config file sourcing without validation - acceptable for single-user local environment."

# Issues identified during review
top_issues:
  - id: "SEC-004-01"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Config file (dictation.env) is sourced directly without validation or permission checks"
    suggested_action: "Add ownership/permission validation before sourcing, or use safer key=value parsing"

    context: "dictation-toggle.sh:19 - source \"$CONFIG_FILE\""
  - id: "TEST-004-01"
    severity: low
    finding: "No automated tests for wrapper script (only manual tests documented)"
    suggested_action: "Consider adding bash unit tests (bats/shunit2) for regression testing"
    suggested_owner: "dev"
    context: "Manual tests are comprehensive and appropriate for this component"

  immediate:
    - action: "Consider adding permission validation for dictation.env in Story 5 setup (chmod 644)"
      refs: ["modules/dictation/config/dictation.env"]
      priority: "optional"
  future:
    - action: "Implement bash unit tests for wrapper script (bats or shunit2)"
      refs: ["modules/dictation/dictation-toggle.sh"]
      priority: "nice-to-have"
    - action: "Audit environment variable usage - verify all exported vars are consumed by dictate.py"
      refs: ["modules/dictation/dictation-toggle.sh:49-55", "modules/dictation/dictate.py"]
      priority: "low"
    - action: "Complete pending manual tests (symlink, reboot persistence) during Story 6 E2E testing"
      refs: ["docs/stories/story-4-hotkey-wrapper.md:369"]
      priority: "low"

# Implementation strengths
strengths:
  - "Robust path resolution using readlink -f for symlink safety"
  - "Comprehensive error handling with helpful notifications"
  - "Graceful degradation with fallback defaults"
  - "Excellent documentation with 40+ well-commented config settings"
  - "Clean shell scripting: set -euo pipefail, proper quoting"
  - "Exit code propagation preserves dictate.py status"
  - "User-friendly configuration with examples"

# Lessons learned
lessons:
  - "XFCE requires xfsettingsd restart after xfconf-query hotkey registration"
  - "Dual-layer default system (script fallback + config defaults) provides excellent resilience"
  - "readlink -f + cd + pwd pattern is robust for portable path resolution"

# Audit trail
history:
  - at: "2025-10-27T12:00:00Z"
    gate: CONCERNS
    note: "Initial review - high quality implementation with minor security advisory"
    reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

# Final assessment
assessment: |
  Story 4 delivers a high-quality hotkey wrapper solution with excellent bash scripting practices.
  All 9 acceptance criteria are satisfied. The wrapper successfully bridges XFCE hotkeys with the
  Python dictation core, providing seamless user experience.
  
  The CONCERNS gate status reflects a minor security consideration (config file sourcing) which
  is acceptable for single-user local environment but noted for awareness. Security risk is
  medium-low and non-blocking.
  
  Implementation demonstrates strong technical skills, user-focused design, and sets solid
  foundation for Story 5 (automated setup).
  
  RECOMMENDATION: Story is READY FOR DONE. Proceed with Story 5 as planned.
