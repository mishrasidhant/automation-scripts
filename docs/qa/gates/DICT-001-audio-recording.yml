# Quality Gate Decision - Story DICT-001
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "DICT-001"
story_title: "Core Dictation Script - Audio Recording"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "All functional requirements met with excellent test coverage (16/16 passing), but identified 3 areas for improvement: missing disk space checks, no structured logging framework, and some magic numbers in timeout logic."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

top_issues:
  - id: "REL-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "No disk space check before recording starts - could fail mid-recording with cryptic error"
    suggested_action: "Add shutil.disk_usage() check in start_recording() before creating audio stream"
  - id: "MAINT-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Uses print() statements instead of logging module - difficult to debug in production"
    suggested_action: "Replace print statements with logging.info/error for better production diagnostics"
  - id: "MAINT-002"
    severity: low
    finding: "Magic number timeout (range(50) for 5 seconds) not clearly documented"
    suggested_action: "Extract STOP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 5 constant at module level"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns - proper file permissions, no sensitive data exposure, safe signal handling"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient callback-based streaming, appropriate sample rate, minimal latency"
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Good error handling but lacks structured logging and disk space pre-check"
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Well-documented and structured, but print-based debugging and magic numbers reduce maintainability"

risk_summary:

    critical: 0
    high: 0
    medium: 3
    low: 2
  highest:
    - risk: "Audio device unavailable"
      score: 6
      mitigation: "Handled with clear error messages and notifications"
    - risk: "Process orphaning"
      score: 6
      mitigation: "Stale lock detection and cleanup logic"
    - risk: "Signal handling failure"
      score: 6
      mitigation: "Comprehensive signal handlers with graceful shutdown"
  recommendations:

    monitor:
      - "Add disk space check before recording (REL-001)"
      - "Consider adding logging framework for future debugging"

recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Add disk space validation before recording starts"
      refs: ["modules/dictation/dictate.py:129-139"]
    - action: "Implement Python logging module for production diagnostics"
      refs: ["modules/dictation/dictate.py (throughout)"]
    - action: "Extract timeout constant for clarity"
      refs: ["modules/dictation/dictate.py:267"]
    - action: "Consider making paths configurable via environment variables for testing flexibility"
      refs: ["modules/dictation/dictate.py:37-38"]

test_architecture:
  strengths:
    - "Excellent unit test coverage (16 tests, all passing)"
    - "Smart mocking allows tests to run without sounddevice dependencies"
    - "Comprehensive manual testing guide with 10 scenarios"
    - "Tests cover all acceptance criteria"
    - "Proper isolation with setup/teardown"
  concerns:
    - "No test for _audio_callback() method directly"
    - "Signal handler not unit tested (manual verification only)"
    - "Timeout behavior in stop_recording() not explicitly tested"
  recommendation: "Current test architecture is appropriate for foundational story. Consider adding integration tests when transcription module (Story 2) is implemented."

code_quality_highlights:
  - "Clean class-based design with clear separation of concerns"
  - "Excellent error handling with user-friendly messages"
  - "Signal-based IPC properly handles background recording"
  - "Comprehensive inline documentation"
  - "Defensive programming (stale lock detection, process validation)"
  - "Proper resource cleanup throughout"

requirements_traceability:
  status: "Complete"
  coverage: "9/9 acceptance criteria validated"
