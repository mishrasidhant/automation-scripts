# Story 10.6: Enhanced Diagnostics for Dictation Troubleshooting - Brownfield Enhancement

## User Story

As a **dictation system user or troubleshooter**,  
I want **comprehensive diagnostics that validate the entire dictation stack (systemd, hotkey, UV environment, and recent operations)**,  
So that **I can quickly identify and fix issues without manual investigation across multiple components**.

---

## Story Context

### Existing System Integration

- **Integrates with:** 
  - Story 9: `scripts/check-hotkey-status.sh` (existing diagnostic script)
  - Story 10.5: `scripts/dictation-toggle.sh` (UV environment validation and logging)
  - UV package manager environment (`.venv/`, `uv.lock`)
  
- **Technology:** Bash scripting, systemd user services, UV package manager, Python module validation

- **Follows pattern:** 
  - Existing diagnostic sections in `check-hotkey-status.sh` (lines 70-255)
  - Colored output with log_success/log_error/log_warning functions (lines 40-62)
  - Six-section diagnostic structure with overall status tracking
  
- **Touch points:**
  - `scripts/check-hotkey-status.sh` (main integration point - add 2 new sections)
  - `/tmp/dictation-toggle.log` (log file created by Story 10.5)
  - UV environment health validation commands
  - Existing logging functions and color scheme

### Background

Stories 9, 10, and 10.5 have established a complete dictation workflow with multiple integration points:

- **Story 9:** Systemd service for hotkey persistence + initial diagnostic script
- **Story 10:** SIGTERM hang fix for recording process
- **Story 10.5:** UV environment auto-sync and comprehensive logging to `/tmp/dictation-toggle.log`

However, the current diagnostic script (`check-hotkey-status.sh`) only validates the hotkey registration layer (systemd, xfconf, xfsettingsd) but doesn't check:

1. **UV Environment Health:** Is the Python environment synced and ready?
2. **Module Import Capability:** Can `automation_scripts.dictation` be imported?
3. **Recent Operation Logs:** What happened during the last dictation attempt?

This gap means users experiencing dictation failures (e.g., first-run failures, module import errors) must manually:
- Run `uv sync` to check environment
- Try importing the module manually
- Cat the log file to see recent errors

This story enhances the diagnostic script to provide a **single comprehensive status check** covering all layers.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **UV Environment Health Check Added (New Section 7)**
   - Script validates UV environment is synced and healthy
   - Checks `.venv/` directory exists
   - Checks `uv.lock` file is present
   - Tests module import: `uv run python -c "import automation_scripts.dictation"`
   - Shows `✓ UV environment ready` (green) when healthy
   - Shows `✗ UV environment NOT ready` (red) when broken
   - Provides actionable fix command: `Fix: uv sync --extra dictation`
   - Displays any import errors if module validation fails

2. **Recent Log Display Added (New Section 8)**
   - Displays last 10 lines from `/tmp/dictation-toggle.log`
   - Uses `tail -n 10` with proper formatting (indented, prefixed)
   - Handles missing log file gracefully with warning message
   - Shows: `ℹ No log file found (dictation not used yet)` when file missing
   - Helps diagnose recent operation failures without manual log inspection

3. **Comprehensive Status Output Maintained**
   - All existing 6 sections preserved unchanged (systemd, xfconf, xfsettingsd, desktop, logs, config files)
   - New sections added as Section 7 (UV Environment) and Section 8 (Recent Dictation Logs)
   - Color-coded status indicators maintained (✓ green, ✗ red, ⚠ yellow, ℹ blue)
   - Overall status tracking includes new checks (exit code 1 if UV or imports fail)
   - Summary section updated to mention UV environment health

4. **Actionable Troubleshooting Tips**
   - Each failure mode provides clear fix commands
   - UV environment failures show: `Fix: uv sync --extra dictation`
   - Module import failures show: `Fix: cd <project_root> && uv sync`
   - Recent log section references full log: `View full log: cat /tmp/dictation-toggle.log`

### Integration Requirements

5. **Existing Diagnostic Functionality Preserved**
   - All 6 existing checks continue to work unchanged (lines 70-255)
   - No changes to logging functions (log_success, log_error, log_warning, log_info)
   - No changes to color constants or status tracking
   - No changes to summary output logic
   - Script exit codes maintain existing behavior (0 = all pass, 1 = failures detected)

6. **Integration with Story 10.5 Logging**
   - Reads log file from `/tmp/dictation-toggle.log` (same location as Story 10.5)
   - No modification to log file (read-only access)
   - Handles case where log file doesn't exist yet (first run)
   - Log display format consistent with other sections

7. **UV Environment Check Follows Existing Pattern**
   - Uses same validation approach as Story 10.5 (lines 50-90 in `dictation-toggle.sh`)
   - Checks `.venv/` existence, `uv.lock` presence, Python import test
   - Error messages match Story 10.5 style and actionability
   - No duplication of UV sync logic (diagnostic only, not remediation)

### Quality Requirements

8. **Script Performance Target Met**
   - Total execution time remains < 2 seconds (including new checks)
   - UV environment checks add ~0.3-0.5 seconds maximum
   - Log file reading adds ~0.1 seconds
   - No blocking operations or long-running commands

9. **Error Handling is Robust**
   - Script doesn't fail if UV not installed (shows error, continues)
   - Script doesn't fail if log file missing (shows info message, continues)
   - Import test failures are caught and displayed clearly
   - All errors update `OVERALL_STATUS` variable for exit code

10. **User Experience Improvements**
    - New sections clearly labeled (numbered 7 and 8)
    - All output maintains consistent formatting and indentation
    - Color coding aids quick visual scanning
    - Summary section provides high-level health status
    - Next steps are obvious from output

## Technical Notes

### Integration Approach

Enhance `scripts/check-hotkey-status.sh` by adding two new diagnostic sections before the Summary section:

**Section 7: UV Environment Health (after line 255)**

```bash
# Check 7: UV Environment Health
log_header "7. UV Environment Health"

# Detect project root
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "$(readlink -f "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")")" && pwd)"
PROJECT_ROOT="$(cd "$SCRIPT_DIR/.." && pwd)"

if ! command -v uv &> /dev/null; then
    log_error "UV package manager not found"
    log_info "Install: curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh"
else
    log_success "UV package manager available"
    
    # Check .venv directory
    if [ -d "$PROJECT_ROOT/.venv" ]; then
        log_success "Virtual environment exists (.venv)"
    else
        log_error "Virtual environment missing (.venv)"
        log_info "Fix: cd $PROJECT_ROOT && uv sync --extra dictation"
    fi
    
    # Check uv.lock file
    if [ -f "$PROJECT_ROOT/uv.lock" ]; then
        log_success "UV lock file exists (uv.lock)"
    else
        log_warning "UV lock file missing (uv.lock)"
        log_info "Run: cd $PROJECT_ROOT && uv sync"
    fi
    
    # Test module import
    log_info "Testing dictation module import..."
    if uv run python -c "import automation_scripts.dictation" 2>/dev/null; then
        log_success "Dictation module imports successfully"
    else
        log_error "Dictation module import FAILED"
        log_info "Fix: cd $PROJECT_ROOT && uv sync --extra dictation"
        log_info "Check logs above for specific import errors"
    fi
fi

# Check 8: Recent Dictation Operation Logs
log_header "8. Recent Dictation Logs (Last 10 Lines)"

LOG_FILE="/tmp/dictation-toggle.log"

if [ -f "$LOG_FILE" ]; then
    log_info "Log file: $LOG_FILE"
    echo ""
    tail -n 10 "$LOG_FILE" 2>/dev/null | sed 's/^/    /' || {
        log_warning "Could not read log file"
    }
    echo ""
    log_info "View full log: cat $LOG_FILE"
else
    log_info "No log file found (dictation not used yet)"
    log_info "Log will be created on first use: $LOG_FILE"
fi
```

**Summary Section Update (after line 258):**

Add UV environment mention to summary:

```bash
if [ $OVERALL_STATUS -eq 0 ]; then
    echo -e "${GREEN}✓ All checks passed!${NC}"
    echo ""
    echo "Your dictation system is healthy:"
    echo "  - Hotkey registration: Working"
    echo "  - UV environment: Ready"
    echo "  - Recent operations: No errors"
    echo ""
    echo "The keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+') should work correctly."
    echo ""
else
    echo -e "${RED}✗ Issues detected!${NC}"
    echo ""
    echo "Some checks failed. Review the output above for details."
    echo ""
    echo "Common fixes:"
    echo "  - Install service: ./scripts/install-hotkey-service.sh"
    echo "  - Sync UV environment: uv sync --extra dictation"
    echo "  - Register hotkey: ./scripts/register-hotkey.sh"
    echo "  - Start service: systemctl --user start $SERVICE_NAME"
    echo "  - View logs: cat /tmp/dictation-toggle.log"
    echo ""
fi
```

### Existing Pattern Reference

Follow the established diagnostic pattern from existing sections:

```70:113:scripts/check-hotkey-status.sh
# Check 1: Systemd User Service Status
log_header "1. Systemd Service Status"

if ! command -v systemctl &> /dev/null; then
    log_error "systemctl command not found (systemd not installed)"
else
    if systemctl --user status > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        log_success "systemd user services available"
        
        # Check if service exists
        if systemctl --user list-unit-files "$SERVICE_NAME" | grep -q "$SERVICE_NAME"; then
            log_success "Service file installed: $SERVICE_NAME"
            
            # Check if enabled
            if systemctl --user is-enabled "$SERVICE_NAME" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
                log_success "Service enabled (will start on login)"
            else
                log_error "Service NOT enabled"
                log_info "Fix: systemctl --user enable $SERVICE_NAME"
            fi
            
            # Check if active
            if systemctl --user is-active "$SERVICE_NAME" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
                log_success "Service active (running/completed)"
            else
                STATUS=$(systemctl --user is-active "$SERVICE_NAME" 2>&1 || echo "unknown")
                log_error "Service NOT active (status: $STATUS)"
                log_info "Fix: systemctl --user start $SERVICE_NAME"
            fi
            
            # Show detailed status
            echo ""
            echo "  Service Details:"
            systemctl --user status "$SERVICE_NAME" --no-pager -l 2>&1 | sed 's/^/    /' || true
            
        else
            log_error "Service file NOT installed"
            log_info "Fix: Run ./scripts/install-hotkey-service.sh"
        fi
    else
        log_error "systemd user services not running"
        log_info "Check: systemctl --user status"
    fi
fi
```

Apply same structure: command availability check → success/error logging → actionable fix commands.

### Key Constraints

- **No changes to existing 6 sections** (lines 70-255 remain unchanged)
- **No changes to logging functions** (lines 40-62 remain unchanged)
- **No remediation logic** (diagnostic only, no auto-fixing)
- **Read-only log file access** (no writing to log, just reading)
- **Fast execution** (< 2 seconds total, new checks add ~0.5s)
- **Graceful degradation** (script continues even if UV or logs unavailable)

---

## Definition of Done

- [x] Section 7 (UV Environment Health) added to diagnostic script
- [x] Section 8 (Recent Dictation Logs) added to diagnostic script
- [x] All existing 6 sections continue to work unchanged
- [x] Script execution time remains < 2 seconds

---

## Risk and Compatibility Check

### Minimal Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** UV import test (`uv run python -c "import..."`) might take too long or fail unexpectedly, slowing down diagnostic script.

**Mitigation:**
- Import test is fast (~0.3s when environment healthy)
- Timeout not needed (UV run has internal timeout)
- Errors are caught and displayed, script continues gracefully
- No blocking operations or infinite loops

**Rollback:** 
- Simple git revert of `scripts/check-hotkey-status.sh`
- No side effects (read-only diagnostic script)
- No persistent state changes

### Compatibility Verification

- [x] **No breaking changes to existing APIs:** Script interface unchanged (same command, same exit codes)
- [x] **Database changes:** N/A (no database involved)
- [x] **UI changes follow existing design patterns:** Uses existing log_success/log_error/log_warning functions
- [x] **Performance impact is negligible:** ~0.5s added to 1-1.5s baseline = < 2s total (acceptable)

---

## Validation Checklist

### Scope Validation

- [x] **Story can be completed in one development session:** Estimated 30-45 minutes
- [x] **Integration approach is straightforward:** Add 2 sections to existing script
- [x] **Follows existing patterns exactly:** Mirrors existing section structure and logging
- [x] **No design or architecture work required:** Pure enhancement following established patterns

### Clarity Check

- [x] **Story requirements are unambiguous:** Specific sections, checks, and output format defined
- [x] **Integration points are clearly specified:** Lines referenced, functions identified, log file path explicit
- [x] **Success criteria are testable:** 4 manual test scenarios with clear pass/fail criteria
- [x] **Rollback approach is simple:** Git revert, no side effects

---

## Priority and Estimation

**Priority:** **MEDIUM** (Enhancement - improves usability but system is functional without it)

**Estimate:** **30-45 minutes** (including testing)

**Effort Breakdown:**
- Implementation: 20-25 minutes (add 2 sections, update summary)
- Testing: 10-15 minutes (4 test scenarios)
- Documentation: 5 minutes (optional README update)

---

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: All Systems Healthy

**Setup:** Healthy environment (UV synced, log file exists)

**Expected Output:**
- Section 7: All UV checks pass (✓ green)
- Section 8: Last 10 log lines displayed
- Summary: "All checks passed!"
- Exit code: 0

---

### Test 2: UV Environment Missing

**Setup:** Delete `.venv/` directory

**Expected Output:**
- Section 7: 
  - `✗ Virtual environment missing (.venv)` (red)
  - `Fix: cd <project_root> && uv sync --extra dictation`
- Summary: "Issues detected!"
- Exit code: 1

---

### Test 3: Module Import Fails

**Setup:** Break UV environment (corrupt a Python file in `.venv/`)

**Expected Output:**
- Section 7:
  - `✗ Dictation module import FAILED` (red)
  - `Fix: cd <project_root> && uv sync --extra dictation`
- Exit code: 1

---

### Test 4: Log File Missing

**Setup:** Delete `/tmp/dictation-toggle.log`

**Expected Output:**
- Section 8:
  - `ℹ No log file found (dictation not used yet)` (blue)
  - `Log will be created on first use: /tmp/dictation-toggle.log`
- Exit code: 0 (not a failure condition)

---

## Related Work

- **Depends on:** 
  - Story 9 (systemd hotkey + initial diagnostic script) - COMPLETE
  - Story 10.5 (UV environment auto-sync + logging) - COMPLETE
  
- **Blocks:** None (enhancement only)

- **Related:** 
  - Epic: UV Migration (ensures diagnostic coverage across all UV-related functionality)
  - Story 10: SIGTERM fix (log file may contain stop operation details)

---

## Documentation Updates (Optional)

If time permits, update README.md to mention enhanced diagnostics:

**Section:** "Troubleshooting"

Add:
```markdown
### Comprehensive Diagnostics

The diagnostic script now validates the entire dictation stack:

```bash
./scripts/check-hotkey-status.sh
```

**Checks performed:**
1. Systemd service status (installation, enabled, active)
2. XFCE hotkey registration (xfconf-query)
3. XFCE settings daemon (xfsettingsd running)
4. Desktop environment (XFCE detection)
5. Service logs (recent systemd journal entries)
6. Configuration files (service file, registration scripts)
7. **UV environment health** (venv, lock file, module import) ✨ NEW
8. **Recent dictation logs** (last 10 operations) ✨ NEW

All checks provide actionable fix commands when issues are detected.
```
